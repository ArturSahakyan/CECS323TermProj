# CECS323TermProj
MongoDB Term Project for Fall 2023 CECS323

Final project for the 2023 Fall Semester of CECS323.
This group was tasked with creating an application using PyMongo that would simulate a database where students can enroll in classes!

How branches are setup:
  -  Main (Main release of project, rarely touch pls)
  -  Develop (Working versions of the project, no bugs/errors)
  -  Feature (Each team member branches off *Develop* to work on a specific feature, merge into *Develop* after completion)
