# CECS323TermProj
MongoDB Term Project for Fall 2023 CECS323

Final project for the 2023 Fall Semester of CECS323.
This group was tasked with creating an application using PyMongo that would simulate a database where students can enroll in classes!

How branches are setup:
  -  *main* (*main* release of project, rarely touch pls)
  -  *develop* (Working versions of the project, no bugs/errors)
  -  Feature "{topic}_feat" (Each team member branches off *develop* to work on a specific feature, merge into *develop* after completion)
